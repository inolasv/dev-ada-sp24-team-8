      "changed a bit. Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic? Okay, here we go. She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right? She kind of bumps along... ...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code... -- dit-dit-dit -- along the side... ...below the waterline. Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood. Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises... ...it spills over the\n",

      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure. So, what happens? She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel. And the stern... ...falls back level. Then... ...as the bow sinks... ...it pulls the stern vertical... ...and then finally detaches. Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes... ...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM... ...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",

      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course, the\n",

      "or not, Mr. Lovett? It's been 84 years... ...and I can still smell\n",

      "It was an accident. An accident? It was. Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over\n",
      "to see the, uh... ...uh, uh, the uh... - Propellers?\n",
      "- Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone\n",
      "overboard but Mr. Dawson here... ...saved me. And almost\n",
      "went over himself. You wanted to see the...\n",
      "She wanted to see the propellers. Like I said, women and\n",
      "machinery do not mix. Was that the way of it? Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it. Well, the boy's a hero then. Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done. So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh? Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside. Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy? Of course. Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it. Is that the going rate\n",
      "for saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. What to do? I know. Perhaps you could join us for\n",
      "dinner tomorrow evening... ...to regale our group... ...with your heroic tale. Sure.\n",
      "Count me in. Good.\n",
      "It's settled then. This should be interesting. Can I bum a smoke? You'll want to tie those. It's interesting... ...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly... ...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes. I know you've been melancholy. I don't pretend to know why. I intended to save this... ...until the engagement\n",
      "gala next week... ...but, I thought... ...tonight. Good gracious. Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you. - Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes. 56 carats to be exact. It was worn by Louis XVI. And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer. - The Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes. It's overwhelming. Well, it's for royalty. We are royalty, Rose. You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you... ...if you would not deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died. And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country... ...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since. You could just call me a\n",
      "tumbleweed blowing in the wind. Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and... ...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up... ...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it? - Mr. Dawson, I--\n",
      "- Jack. Jack. I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did. Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion. You're welcome. Look. I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking. Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? No. No, that's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... ---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out? Well I... It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and... ...all the people in it. And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me... ...powerless to stop it. God,\n",
      "look at that thing. You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom. 500 invitations have gone out. All of Philadelphia society will be there. And all the while I feel I'm... ...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room... ...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs... ...and no one\n",
      "even looks up. Do you love him? Pardon me? Do you love him? You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this. Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not? This is not a suitable conversation. VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question? This is absurd. You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you... ...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude... ...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now... ...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure. I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you. And you've insulted me. Well, you deserved it. - Right.\n",
      "- Right. I thought you were leaving. I am. You are so annoying. Wait. I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave. Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude? What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around? So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something? These are rather good. They're very good, actually. Jack, this is exquisite work. Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree. Paris? You do get around\n",
      "for a p-- Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means. Go on. A poor guy. You can say it. Well, well, well. And these were drawn from life? Well, that's one of the good things about Paris. Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off. You liked this woman. You used her several times. Well. She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see? I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her. No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands. She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute. See? She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though. Oh, and this lady... She used to sit at this bar every night... ...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned... ...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love. We called her Madame Bijoux. See, her clothes are all moth-eaten. Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you. And? You wouldn't have jumped. But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband. Rose has already done that. Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman. Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us. Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea. We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it. The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck. What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip. Countess. So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers? No, I don't see\n",
      "the need. We are making excellent time. The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed. We must give them\n",
      "something new to print. This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must... ...make headlines. Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines... ...until they've been properly run in. Of course I'm just a passenger. I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best. But what a glorious end to your final crossing... ...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night... ...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Good man. After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey... ...then I went to Los Angeles to the... ...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each. Why can't I be like you? Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier... only if we just talk about it No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer. Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf. But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff. You mean with one leg on each side? Can you show me? Sure, if you like. Teach me to ride like a man. Chew tobacco like a man. And spit like a man. You didn't learn in finishing school? No. Come on, I'll show you. I'll show you how. Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait. I couldn't possibly, Jack. Watch closely. That's disgusting. Your turn That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back. Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck. You see the range on that thing? Okay, go. That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up. Mother. May I introduce Jack Dawson? Charmed, I'm sure. The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly. Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot. Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, Mother? See you at dinner, Jack. Uh, son? Son! Do you have any idea what you're doing? Not really. You're about to go into the snake pit. What are you going to wear? I figured. Come on. I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size. Pretty close. You shine up like a new penny. Good evening, sir. Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship. - Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones. Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose? She'll be along. There is the Countess. I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it. Darling... ...surely you remember Mr. Dawson. It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman. Almost. This is extraordinary. This is a remarkable voyage. - Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic. There's the Countess of Rothes. That's John Jacob Astor... ...the richest man on board. His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she tries to hide it. Quite the scandal. Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim... ...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here... ...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Congratulations. She's splendid. Why, thank you. Escort a lady to dinner? Certainly. Sweet pea, sweet pea. Ain't nothing to it. They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club. Hey, Astor. Hello, Molly. Nice to see you. J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. Well, Jack... ...are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. Oh, yes. He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them. Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps. New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club. Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon. Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good- The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats. Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of help to my fiancée last night. It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist. He showed me some of his work today. Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir. Are all these mine? Start from the outside and work in. He knows every rivet in her. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Thank you, Rose. How do you take your caviar, sir? No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much. Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. How do you have means to travel? I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker. A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson? And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing? Yes, ma'am, I do. I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me. I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper. I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet. Where I'll wind up. One night I'm sleeping under a bridge... ...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people. I'll take more of that. Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you'll get dealt. You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal. Make each day count. Well said, Jack. Hear, hear. To making it count. To making it count. Bravo. But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove. He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire. Next is brandy in the smoking room. Join me in a brandy, gentlemen? Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe. Ladies, thank you for your company. May I escort you to the cabin? No, I'll stay here. Here, Molly. Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay with the women. No, thanks. I have to head back. That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you. But Dawson, good of you to come. Must you go? Time for me to row with the other slaves. Good night, Rose. Want to go to a real party? Is okay I put my hand here? I can't understand you. I'm going to dance with her now. Come on. Come on. Come with me. Jack. Jack, wait. I can't do this. We'll have to get a bit closer. Like this. You're still my best girl, Cora. - I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it. Don't think. Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack! Wh at? Wait! Jack, no. --Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act. That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it. What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink? Get out of here. Are you all right? I'm fine. Two out of three. So... ...you think you're tough? Let's see you do this. Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up. Jesus! You okay? I haven't done that in years. Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go. Coffee, sir? You didn't come to me last night. I was tired. Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting. I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me. You will never behave like that again. I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command. I'm your fiancée. My fiancée. My fiancée! Yes, you are! And my wife! My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me! You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband. Because I will not be made a fool of. Is this in any way unclear? No. Good. Excuse me. Oh, Miss Rose. We had a little accident. - That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry. Let me help you. It's all right, miss. It's all right, miss. Tea, Trudy. You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand? Rose, I forbid it. Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed. This is not a game. Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone. Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day. Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name. That name is the only card we have to play. I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival. How can you put this on me? Why are you being so selfish? I'm being selfish? Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? To see our fine things sold at auction? Our memories scattered? It's so unfair. Of course it's unfair. We're women. Our choices are never easy. Protect them by Thy guiding hand From every peril on the land O, spirit whom the Father sent To spread abroad the firmament O, wind of heaven, by Thy might Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight And keep them by Thy watchful care... Hello, Mr. Andrews. I need to talk to someone. You're not supposed to be in here. I was here last night, remember? No. Now please turn around. He'll tell you. I just need to talk-- Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater... ...are still appreciative of your assistance. They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude-- I don't want your money. --And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here... ...is no longer appropriate. Let me speak to Rose. Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs... ...and that he stays there? Yes, sir. Come along, you. Hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea Why are there two steering wheels? We use this one near shore. Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam. Thank you, Sparks. Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit. Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right. Okay, now let it go. - It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent. Mr. Andrews...Forgive me. I did the sum\n",
      "in my head... ...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned... Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you? In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits... ...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one. But it was thought,\n",
      "by some... ...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered. So, I was overruled. It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship. Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true. She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need. Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room. Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you. - I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No. Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged. I'm marrying Cal. I love Cal. Rose... ...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even. But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding ...wonderful girl... ...woman, that I've ever known. Jack, I-- No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama-- I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works. I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket. I have nothing to offer\n",

      "knowing you'll be all right. That's all that I want. Well, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Really. Really? I don't think so. They've got you trapped, Rose. And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free. Maybe not right away... ...because you're strong... ...but sooner or later that\n",

      "burn out. It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack. You're right. Only you can do that. I'm going back. Leave me alone. Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers. Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice. Oh, my dear. And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns. Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been. Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender. She knows I detest the color. So, she did it only to spite me. If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner. Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",

      "he's standing there and... ...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand... ...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed. 26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him. He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship... ...they're gonna see in time to turn. But the ship's too big\n",

      "This is the sitting room. - Will this light do?\n",
      "- What? Don't artists need good light? That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in... ...such horrible conditions. Monet! - Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course. Look at his use of color here.\n",

      "and brandy hold out. That's nice. What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire? A diamond. A very rare diamond. Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls. Wearing this. All right. Wearing only this. The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll. As a paying customer... ...I expect to get\n",

      "Keep them on me. And try to stay still. So serious. I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing. He does landscapes. - Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry. No laughing. My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time. It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life... ...up until then, at least. So what happened next? You mean,\n",
      "did we do it? Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine. Jack was very professional. Thank you. What are you doing? Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me? Gentlemen, would you excuse me. None of the stewards\n",

      "- Right. Anything missing? I have a better idea. GOI you! Did you see those guys' faces? Did you see them? When the ship docks... ...I'm getting off with you. This is crazy. I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. Here, look at this. Look at that, would you? They're warmer than we are. If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not. Bugger me! Pick up, you bastards! Is anyone there?! What do you see? Iceberg, right ahead! Thank you. Iceberg ahead! Hard a' starboard! Turn! Turn! Srnartly! Full astern! Hard over. Helm's hard over, sir. Go, lads, go! Bring that steam down! Bring it down! Shut all the dampers! Shut them! Hold it. Hold it! Now! Engage reversing engine! Why ain't they turning? Is it hard over?! It is, sir. Hard over. Come on, come on, come on. Turn. Yes. It's going to hit! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Hard to port! Hard to port! Get back! Let's go! They're closing the doors! Get out! Get out the door! Go! Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go! Go! Go! Out! Out! Oh, my God. That was a close shave. Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ! Note the time. Enter it in the log. What was that, Mr. Murdoch? An iceberg, sir. I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close. I tried to port round it, but-- - Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir. All stop. Have the carpenter sound the ship. Come on, let's get the hell out of here! Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder. Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade. That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything? No, thank you. There's talk of an iceberg. I don't see anything. Do you? If this is where the rats are going, I am, too. - You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency. - There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms. Now, you moron! Did I miss the fun? - Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there- Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse. - Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead. - Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater. This is bad. We should tell Mother and Cal. I think they're very good, sir. Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed. We've been looking for you, miss. Here we go. Something serious has happened. Yes, it has. Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared. Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him. - Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what? What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency. - Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it. This is horseshit! Don't you believe it. - He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional. I was with him the entire time. Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear. Real slick. They put it in my pocket. - Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket. \"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\" That was reported stolen. I just borrowed it. Oh, we have an honest thief. You know I didn't do this, Rose. Don't believe them. You know it. Let's go, son. You know I didn't do it! There's a good lad. Come on. You know I didn't do it! You know me! This is most unfortunate, Captain. Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes... ...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six. That's right. When can we get underway? That's five compartments. She can float with four compartments breached,\n",

      "the water will spill... ...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next... ...back and back. There's no stopping it. The pumps. The pumps buy you time, but minutes only. As of now, no matter what we do... ...Titanic will founder. But this ship can't sink. She's made of iron. I assure you, she can. And she will. It's a mathematical certainty. How much time? An hour. Two, at most. How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir. Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay. Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it? Look at me when I'm talking to you! - Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy. You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck. I said, not now. I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly. It's quite cold out. May I suggest topcoats and hats? This is ridiculous. Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution. Everybody up! Lifebelts on! What's he on about? - Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it? Just put them on. C.O.D.? Sir? That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position. Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance. Blimey. Keep lowering! Keep lowering! Steady! Make it taut! And winch out! Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft! Release those ties! Roll back that cover! Smartly now! Where are the passengers? They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines! Care for a drink, sir? Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels. Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out. Nobody knows what's going on. Just like the damn English--everything by the book. No need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return. Mr. Andrews. I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. The ship will sink. You're certain? In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic. And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? Yes. I understand. Over here, son. Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office. Go on. I'll watch him. Aye. Right. Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir. She's the only one responding? The only one close. They'll be here in four hours. Four hours?! Thank you, Bride. My God. We are swung out and ready, sir. Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats? Yes. Women and children first, yes. Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please! Step this way, please. That's right. Come towards me. Thank you. Good. For the time being,\n",

      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic. \"Wedding Dance.\" Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on. Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around. It isn't time to go to the boats yet! Please, stay calm. Make sure you have your lifebelts on. Let women and children through to the front. What are we doing? Waiting. Once first-class people\n",

      "Lower away together! Steady, lads! You know, I do believe this ship may sink. I've been asked to give you\n",
      "this small token of our appreciation. Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat. Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen? Only women at this time, sir. Will the lifeboats be\n",

      "with only 12. 12! Well, we weren't sure of\n",
      "the weight, Mr. Andrews. These boats may\n",
      "buckle. Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast\n",
